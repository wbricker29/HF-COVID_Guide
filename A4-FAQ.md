# FAQ

We wanted to make space to directly answer the questions we are getting. This will be updated as new questions come in.

## Do you guys know if affiliation rule applies to start ups who have only raised via SAFEs (from angels and VCs), which have not been converted?


## Can anyone comment on the payroll tax credit (50% of the first $10,000 per employee?)and payroll tax deferment that I believe is separate from the payroll related loans? Is there an application for this credit or is it automatic?

## do you know if financial services (lending) startups can qualify?
