### Do you guys know if affiliation rule applies to start ups who have only raised via SAFEs (from angels and VCs), which have not been converted?

### As a business, are my 1099 contractors considered my employees?

No, they are not. Per [Treasury guidance](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/PPP--IFRN%20FINAL.pdf):
>_Do independent contractors count as employees for purposes of PPP loan calculations?_ <br/> 
No, independent contractors have the ability to apply for a PPP loan on their own
so they do not count for purposes of a borrower’s PPP loan calculation.
