*Please note – defining who controls your business is a key question in understanding your eligibility. Things are still less clear than we would like when it comes to defining any controlling interests. Given what guidance and interpretations we have seen ([discussed here](A2-Affiliation_Control.md)) __our understanding is that if the founding group__:

- owns a majority (>50%) of equity voting rights, and would retain that ownership through the exercising of convertible securities
- does not have investors with negative rights on day-to-day operations

the size requirement applies to only the applicant company (not its investors or entities it investor controls).
