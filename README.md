## Note on Resources

There is a lot of speculation out there. The most reliable resources are from the SBA & Treasury:

- [Treasury Department Portal](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/top-priorities/cares-act/assistance-for-small-businesses)
  - [Treasury Department Borrower Guide](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/PPP%20Borrower%20Information%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf)
- [SBA Portal](https://www.sba.gov/disaster-assistance/coronavirus-covid-19)
  - [SBA PPP Page](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program-ppp)
  - [SBA Form](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/PPP%20Borrower%20Application%20Form.pdf)

## Our Recommendation

### Look at the PPP Loan First

We recommend that all our portfolio companies __consider first and foremost the PPP loan__. We believe it has the most favorable terms for our founders

- Potential forgiveness for approved payroll usage (up to 100% of principle)
- No personal guarantee
- No collateral requirements
- Rate and Term

### Start the Application Process NOW!

[Guidance Here](A3-Application%20Guidance.md)

### Understand What the Loan Entails

See [here](1-Loan_PPP.md) for details

- Understand the __certifications__ you will be making (for a full list, see form)
  - including the requirement to retain employee and wage levels
    - forgiveness  will be reduced if there is a decrease in the number of employees or wages in excess of 25% of total wages during the period.
    - Employers must bring back employees terminated from February 15 to April 27 before June 30th
- Stand up a process to __track spending now__ - because you will be called upon to account for the use of proceeds
- Understand the caps placed on the loan AND that eligibility <> forgiveness
  - Employee salary qualifies up to 100K per Year
    - __Impact__ - not all of your salary expenses may be used to calculate loan size
  - the maximum amount of the lone that can be applied to non-payroll operating expenses is 25%
    - __Impact__ -  your loan may not be fully forgivable even if you use it on qualified operating expenses

### For those founders worried about eligibility

A lot remains unknown, and information is constantly evolving. As of now, the biggest questions for venture-backed startups are around size requirements and the affiliation clause. Certain negative rights held by investors on day-to-day operations may trigger the affiliation rules.

Thus, we recommend that founders __discuss with their investors the possibility of changing applicable covenants to enhance your eligibility.__

As of now, our best guess on the negative clauses around day-to-day operations that would likely impact affiliation are (Per [NVCA Guidance](https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VC-SBA-Lending-and-Affiliation-Guidance-for-SBA-Loan-Programs.pdf)):

- Making, declaring, or paying distributions or dividends other than tax distributions
- Establishing a quorum at a meeting of stockholders (and likely, by extension, at a meeting of the board)
- Approving or making changes to the company’s budget or approving capital expenditures outside the budget
- Determining employee compensation
- Hiring and firing officers and executives.
- Blocking changes in the company’s strategic direction.
- Establishing or amending an incentive or employee stock ownership plan.
- Incurring or guaranteeing debts or obligations.
- Initiating or defending a lawsuit.
- Entering contracts or joint ventures.
- Amending or terminating leases.

Note: investors will have to give up those rights irrevocably.

## Guide Intro

Most people have heard about the  COVID-19 Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act by now – the $2 trillion stimulus bill passed by the US government to help businesses and individuals impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic.

However, at Hustle Fund, we have seen founders and investing partners have less clarity on what this bill means for them, and how they can or cannot participate.

 We decided to try to bring some clarity for our founders and the venture/startup community more broadly. We have tried to pull together as much information and resources as possible in this piece, and would love to hear your suggestions for what else would be helpful via pull requests or emailing us [here](mailto:deals@hustlefund.vc).

__Please note, none of this information constitutes legal or financial advice. You should consult a legal representative to get information and guidance that is right for you.__
