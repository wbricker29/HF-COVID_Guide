# Hustle Fund Covid-19 US Relief Guide

## Intro
Most people have heard about the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act by now – the 2 trillion dollar stimulus bill passed by the US government to help businesses and individuals impacted by the coronavirus epidemic.

However, at Hustle Fund, we have seen founders and investing partners have less clarity on what this bill means for them, and how they can or cannot participate.

So we decided to try to bring some clarity for our founders and the venture/startup community more broadly. We have tried to pull together as much information and resources as possible in this piece, and would love to hear your suggestions for what else would be helpful via pull requests or emailing us [Here](mailto:deals@hustlefund.vc)

## How to think about aide options

### Considerations
For picking the best option, you should understand
-	Based on the structure of your business, what programs are you eligible for, and what economic value do they provide?
-	What are the pain points that are impacting you the most, and for how long do you think they will last?
  - Are your costs mostly payroll related?
-	How your choice impacts what other options are available
  - For example,  business can participate in only one of these programs – EG. You cannot take tax deferrals and get an SBA loan.
