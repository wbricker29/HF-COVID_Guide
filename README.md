# Hustle Fund COVID-19 US Relief Guide

## Intro
Most people have heard about the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act by now – the $2 trillion stimulus bill passed by the US government to help businesses and individuals impacted by the coronavirus epidemic.

However, at Hustle Fund, we have seen founders and investing partners have less clarity on what this bill means for them, and how they can or cannot participate.

 We decided to try to bring some clarity for our founders and the venture/startup community more broadly. We have tried to pull together as much information and resources as possible in this piece, and would love to hear your suggestions for what else would be helpful via pull requests or emailing us [Here](mailto:deals@hustlefund.vc)

## What's covered in this guide

At the core of this guide is outlining the available financial aide options for startups

In addition we provide
- Some helpful [resources](A1-Resources.md) we have found during our research
- A high level overview of one of the key questions around PPP loan qualification - [Control and Affiliation](A2_Affiliation_Control.md)
- A side by side [comparison](A3-PPP_EIDL_Compare.md) of EIDL And PPP Loans
- An [FAQ](A4-FAQ.md) that we will try to keep updated

## Our Recommendation
We Recommend that all our portfolio companies __consider first and foremost the PPP loan__. We believe it has the most favorable terms for our founders
-	Potential forgiveness for approved payroll usage (up to 100% of principle)
-	No personal guarantee
-	No collateral requirements
- No requirement to tie damage directly to COVID-19


We recommend that our founders
- Reach out to approved SBA lenders immediately (which can be found via the SBA’s [matching tool](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/lender-match)) per US Senate SBE committee advice
> You can apply for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) at any lending institution that is approved to participate in the program through the existing U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) 7(a) lending program and additional lenders approved by the Department of Treasury. This could be the bank you already use, or a nearby bank. There are thousands of banks that already participate in the SBA’s lending programs, including numerous community banks. You do not have to visit any government institution to apply for the program. You can call your bank or find SBA-approved lenders in your area through SBA’s online Lender Match tool. You can call your local Small Business Development Center or Women’s Business Center and they will provide free assistance and guide you to lenders.

- Start to prepare the proper documentation (which can be found on Neil Dugal’s suggested list of requirements [here](https://www.notion.so/Get-Ready-aea15aa847dd48d9b24816cf3f8f04f0))
  - Generally this will be all information on payroll for the last 12-18 months (Payroll = salaries and wages, severance, leave, benefits and taxes on the first 100k of annual salary (roughly $8,333/month) for US based employees)
- If your investments have negative rights covenants that could impact your eligibility (EG. veto rights) it may be prudent to discuss with your investors the possibility of changing these covenants to enhance your eligibility. Per [NVCA Guidance](https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VC-SBA-Lending-and-Affiliation-Guidance-for-SBA-Loan-Programs.pdf), where yoou can also find a list of the most likely rights to impact your eligibility:
> it may be possible to amend governing documents to mitigate any control rights that are considered high risk for creating affiliation prior to submitting the SBA loan application.

While we understand there are some questions around the affiliation clause (discussed [here](A2-Afilliation_Control,md)) and the eligibility of founding teams with <50% ownership of their company,  the relief that this bill could provide merits the time it takes to start the process.
