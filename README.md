# Hustle Fund COVID-19 US Relief Guide

## Intro

Most people have heard about the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act by now – the $2 trillion stimulus bill passed by the US government to help businesses and individuals impacted by the Coronavirus epidemic.

However, at Hustle Fund, we have seen founders and investing partners have less clarity on what this bill means for them, and how they can or cannot participate.

 We decided to try to bring some clarity for our founders and the venture/startup community more broadly. We have tried to pull together as much information and resources as possible in this piece, and would love to hear your suggestions for what else would be helpful via pull requests or emailing us [here](mailto:deals@hustlefund.vc)

## What's covered in this guide

At the core of this guide is outlining the available financial aide options for startups

In addition we provide

- Some helpful [resources](A1-Resources.md) we have found during our research
- A high level overview of one of the key questions around PPP loan qualification - [Control and Affiliation](A2_Affiliation_Control.md)
- A side by side [comparison](A3-PPP_EIDL_Compare.md) of EIDL And PPP Loans
- An [FAQ](A4-FAQ.md) that we will try to keep updated

## Our Recommendation

We Recommend that all our portfolio companies __consider first and foremost the PPP loan__. We believe it has the most favorable terms for our founders

- Potential forgiveness for approved payroll usage (up to 100% of principle)
- No personal guarantee
- No collateral requirements
- No requirement to tie damage directly to COVID-19

__We recommend that our founders get ready immediately__

- Get your [form](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Paycheck-Protection-Program-Application-3-30-2020-v3.pdf) ready
- Start to prepare the proper documentation (which can be found on Neil Dugal’s suggested list of requirements [here](https://www.notion.so/Get-Ready-aea15aa847dd48d9b24816cf3f8f04f0))
  - Generally this will be:
    - Documentation on payroll for the last 12-18 months (Payroll = salaries and wages, severance, leave, benefits and taxes on the first 100k of annual salary (roughly $8,333/month) for US based employees)
    - Documentation on mortgage, rent and utility payments
- Reach out to approved SBA lenders immediately (which can be found via the SBA’s [matching tool](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/lender-match))

__For those founder's worried about eligibility__

There are still questions around how the affiliation rules will be applied (discussed [here](A2-Affiliation_Control.md)).

However, we recommend that for those founders who have investment structures with negative rights covenants that could impact your eligibility (EG. veto rights) it may be __prudent to discuss with your investors the possibility of changing these covenants to enhance your eligibility.__ Per [NVCA Guidance](https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VC-SBA-Lending-and-Affiliation-Guidance-for-SBA-Loan-Programs.pdf), where you can also find a list of the most likely rights to impact your eligibility:
> it may be possible to amend governing documents to mitigate any control rights that are considered high risk for creating affiliation prior to submitting the SBA loan application.
