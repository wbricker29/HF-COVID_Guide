## Our Recommendation

### Look at the PPP Loan First

We Recommend that all our portfolio companies __consider first and foremost the PPP loan__. We believe it has the most favorable terms for our founders

- Potential forgiveness for approved payroll usage (up to 100% of principle)
- No personal guarantee
- No collateral requirements
- No requirement to tie damage directly to COVID-19
- Rates of 0.5%

### Find your Lender and get your documents ready immediately

- Find a preferred (PLP) SBA lender, and if you don't have a business account with them, start setting one up ASAP (SBA has temporarily redirected traffic away from lender match tool)
- Get your [form](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Paycheck-Protection-Program-Application-3-30-2020-v3.pdf) ready
- Start to prepare the proper documentation 

  - Expected materials include:
    - Quarterly Payroll IRS filing - Form 941
    - Articles of incorporation
    - Tax Return
      - At least 2018
      - Ideally 2019
    - Bank statements
      - At least from Nov 2019 to Feb 2020
      - Ideally FY 2019 and Jan + Feb 2020
    - Any statements regarding non-payroll expenses
    - Payroll service report if your payroll has fluctuated
    - (Probably) Bylaws and Partnership Agreements
    - (Possibly) W2 & 1099 for each employee
- For newer businesses that do not have previous relationships with qualified lenders, they may be required to provide further documentation around
  - Founder’s personal finances
  - The business structure and plan


### For those founder's worried about eligibility

A lot remains unknown, and information is constantly evolving. As of now, the biggest questions for venture backed startups are around size requirements and the affiliation clause (discussed [here](A2-Affiliation_Control.md)).

What we do know is that certain negative rights by investors on day-to-day operations may trigger the affiliation rules.

Thus, we recommend that founders __discuss with their investors the possibility of changing applicable covenants to enhance your eligibility.__ 

As of now, negative clauses around day-to-day operations that likely would impact affiliation are (Per [NVCA Guidance](https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VC-SBA-Lending-and-Affiliation-Guidance-for-SBA-Loan-Programs.pdf)):

- Making, declaring, or paying distributions or dividends other than tax distributions
- Establishing a quorum at a meeting of stockholders (and likely, by extension, at a meeting of the board)
- Approving or making changes to the company’s budget or approving capital expenditures outside the budget
- Determining employee compensation
- Hiring and firing officers and executives.
- Blocking changes in the company’s strategic direction.
- Establishing or amending an incentive or employee stock ownership plan.
- Incurring or guaranteeing debts or obligations.
- Initiating or defending a lawsuit.
- Entering contracts or joint ventures.
- Amending or terminating leases.

## Guide Intro

Most people have heard about the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act by now – the $2 trillion stimulus bill passed by the US government to help businesses and individuals impacted by the Coronavirus epidemic.

However, at Hustle Fund, we have seen founders and investing partners have less clarity on what this bill means for them, and how they can or cannot participate.

 We decided to try to bring some clarity for our founders and the venture/startup community more broadly. We have tried to pull together as much information and resources as possible in this piece, and would love to hear your suggestions for what else would be helpful via pull requests or emailing us [here](mailto:deals@hustlefund.vc)

__Please note, none of this information constitutes legal or financial advice. You should consult a legal representative to get information and guidance that is right for you.__
