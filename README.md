# Hustle Fund COVID-19 US Relief Guide

## Intro
Most people have heard about the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act by now – the $2 trillion stimulus bill passed by the US government to help businesses and individuals impacted by the coronavirus epidemic.

However, at Hustle Fund, we have seen founders and investing partners have less clarity on what this bill means for them, and how they can or cannot participate.

 We decided to try to bring some clarity for our founders and the venture/startup community more broadly. We have tried to pull together as much information and resources as possible in this piece, and would love to hear your suggestions for what else would be helpful via pull requests or emailing us [Here](mailto:deals@hustlefund.vc)

__Please note, none of this information constitutes legal or financial advice. You should consult a legal representative to get information and guidance that is right for you.__

## What's covered in this guide

At the core of this guide is outlining the available financial aide options for startups

| Item | Program | High Level Details | How to Apply |
| --- | --- | --- | --|
| [Loan via CARES Act/PPP](1-Loan_PPP.md) | Paycheck Protection Program (CARES act sections 1101-1107) | A loan for __operating expenses only__ <br/> - 250% of average monthly payroll expenses up to $10mm <br/> - Available to __many__ venture backed startups -__Possible__ forgiveness| TBD <br/> (expecting guidance 3/30) |
| [Loan via EIDL](2-Loan_EIDL.md) | Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLS) | A loan for __operating and non-operating expenses__ <br/> - $2mm max, based on XYZ <br/> - Available to __some__ startups <br/> -__No__ forgiveness | [Here](https://covid19relief.sba.gov/#/)
| [Tax Relief](3-Tax_Relief.md) | CARES act sections 2301,2302 | Options to either <br/>  - defer 2020 payroll tax payment over the next two years <br/>- receive a 50% credit for payroll taxes for certain employers and employees  | TBD



In addition we provide
- Some helpful [resources](A1-Resources.md) we have found during our research
- A high level overview of one of the key questions around PPP loan qualification - [Control and Affiliation](A2_Affiliation_Control.md)
- a side by side [comparison](A3-PPP_EIDL_Compare.md) of EIDL And PPP Loans
- an [FAQ](A4-FAQ.md) that we will try to keep updated

## Our Recommendation
We Recommend that all our portfolio companies __consider first and foremost the PPP loan__. We believe it has the most favorable terms for our founders
-	Potential forgiveness for approved payroll usage (up to 100% of principle)
-	No personal guarantee
-	No collateral requirements
- No requirement to tie damage directly to COVID-19


We recommend that our founders
- Reach out to approved SBA lenders immediately (which can be found via the SBA’s [matching tool](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/lender-match))
- Start to prepare the proper documentation (which can be found on Neil Dugal’s suggested list of requirements [here](https://www.notion.so/Get-Ready-aea15aa847dd48d9b24816cf3f8f04f0))


While we understand there are some questions around the affiliation clause (discussed [here](A2-Afilliation_Control,md)) and the eligibility of founding teams with <50% ownership of their company,  the relief that this bill could provide merits the time it takes to start the process.
