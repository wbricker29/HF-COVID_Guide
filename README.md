# Hustle Fund Covid-19 US Relief Guide

## Intro
Most people have heard about the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act by now â€“ the 2 trillion dollar stimulus bill passed by the US government to help businesses and individuals impacted by the coronavirus epidemic.

However, at Hustle Fund, we have seen founders and investing partners have less clarity on what this bill means for them, and how they can or cannot participate.

So we decided to try to bring some clarity for our founders and the venture/startup community more broadly. We have tried to pull together as much information and resources as possible in this piece, and would love to hear your suggestions for what else would be helpful via pull requests or emailing us [Here](mailto:deals@hustlefund.vc)
