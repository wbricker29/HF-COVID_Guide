## Our Recommendation

### Look at the PPP Loan First

We Recommend that all our portfolio companies __consider first and foremost the PPP loan__. We believe it has the most favorable terms for our founders

- Potential forgiveness for approved payroll usage (up to 100% of principle)
- No personal guarantee
- No collateral requirements
- No requirement to tie damage directly to COVID-19
- Rates of 0.5%

### Get ready immediately for April 3 Application Opening

- Get your [form](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Paycheck-Protection-Program-Application-3-30-2020-v3.pdf) ready
- Find a preferred (PLP) SBA lender, and if you don't have a business account with them, start setting one up ASAP (SBA has temporarily redirected traffic away from lender match tool)
- Start to prepare the proper documentation (more [here](1-Loan_PPP.md))
  - Quarterly Payroll IRS filing - Form 941
  - Articles of incorporation
  - Tax Return
    - Ideally 2019, but can use 2018 If have it
  - Bank statements
    - At least from Nov 2019 to Feb 2020
      - Ideally FY 2019 and Jan + Feb 2020
  - Any statements regarding non-payroll expenses
  - For newer businesses that do not have previous relationships with qualified lenders, they may be required to provide further documentation around
    - Founder’s personal finances
    - The business structure and plan

### For those founder's worried about eligibility

There are still questions around how the affiliation rules will be applied (discussed [here](A2-Affiliation_Control.md)).

However, we recommend that for those founders who have investment structures with negative rights covenants that could impact your eligibility (EG. veto rights) it may be __prudent to discuss with your investors the possibility of changing these covenants to enhance your eligibility.__ Per [NVCA Guidance](https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VC-SBA-Lending-and-Affiliation-Guidance-for-SBA-Loan-Programs.pdf), where you can also find a list of the most likely rights to impact your eligibility:
> it may be possible to amend governing documents to mitigate any control rights that are considered high risk for creating affiliation prior to submitting the SBA loan application.

## Guide Intro

Most people have heard about the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act by now – the $2 trillion stimulus bill passed by the US government to help businesses and individuals impacted by the Coronavirus epidemic.

However, at Hustle Fund, we have seen founders and investing partners have less clarity on what this bill means for them, and how they can or cannot participate.

 We decided to try to bring some clarity for our founders and the venture/startup community more broadly. We have tried to pull together as much information and resources as possible in this piece, and would love to hear your suggestions for what else would be helpful via pull requests or emailing us [here](mailto:deals@hustlefund.vc)
