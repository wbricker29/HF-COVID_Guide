# Appendix Item 2 - Control and Affiliation
## What is the Affiliation and why does it matter
The key question people have been talking about is how the SBA’s existing Affiliation rules will be applied to small businesses seeking PPP aide.

The affiliation rules are a set of standards that define the scope of consideration for size requirements when multiple parties have ownership interests in the firm – EG. Venture backed startups. Affiliation occurs when one company or person has control, or the power to control another.

If the controlling interest is deemed to be an affiliate, the size requirement is applied to all the entities of that affiliate
- If Company A (Venture Firm) has a controlling stake in Company B (Startup), the size requirement is applied to Company A and all its controlled entities

## Affiliation and the CARES Act
Certain business have had The affiliation rules waved
- Any business receiving financial assistance from a Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”).
- Franchises and hospitality businesses (NAICS code 72 “accommodation and food services”) with multiple locations, whereby the 500 person limitation is applicable to all individual locations

However, for all other entities, the CARES act does not provide clarity on how affiliation rules will be applied for the PPP program.

This clearly poses a challenge for both venture firms and their portfolio companies. Thus, we have to ask – what is considered control?

## Affiliation & Control Guidelines

While there is room for interpretation in all these guidelines, below is a rough outline of who who would be defined as controler for a scenario where a company has 2 founders, 2 venture investors, and other investors (who each hold less than 5%)

| Scenario | Controller | Example Ownership Stakes | Outcome |
| --- | :---: | --- | :---: |
| An individual or entity owns \> 50 % of the voting stock of a business <br/> _(Stock ownership (13 C.F.R. § 121.103(c))_ | That individual or entity | Founder = 51% <br/> VC A = 20% <br/> VC B = 10% <br/> Others = 19% | Founder is Controller |
| An individual or entity has a disproportionate ownership stake <br/> _(Stock ownership (13 C.F.R. § 121.103(c))_ | That individual or entity | Founder = 40% <br/> VC A = 15% <br/> VC B = 15% <br/> Others = 30% | Founder is Controller |
| An individual (officer, director, managing member, general parter) controls the board of management of a business (via voting rights or veto rights) <br/> _(Common management (13 C.F.R. § 121.103(e))_ | That individual | Any of the ownership scenarios above, but VC A has veto rights on board motions Or  VC A has 3 out of 5 board seats | VC A |
| A set of owners, who are deemed to have identical (or substantially identical) business or economic interestsown a controlling stake in the company <br/> _(Identity of interest between individuals or businesses , including family members (13 C.F.R. § 121.103(f))_   | These set of Individuals | Founder = 23% <br/> VC A = 23% <br/> VC B = 5% <br/> Others = 49%| Founder &amp; VC A |
| None of the above rules apply | Board and CEO |   |   |
