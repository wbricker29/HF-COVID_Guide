# Appendix Item 2 - Control and Affiliation

## TL;DR

At the highest level - affiliation is still somewhat unclear, and the business community is continuing to seek clarity on affiliation and rules and their application for the PPP program.

However, as of right now, our best guess is that  affiliation will only apply to VCs when they have: 

- +50% of voting rights currently
- +50% of voting rights upon exercise of any outstanding agreements
- applicable negative rights on day-to-day operations 
  - [NVCA guide](https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VC-SBA-Lending-and-Affiliation-Guidance-for-SBA-Loan-Programs.pdf)
- a common President or CEO (affiliation based on management)



## What is the Affiliation and why does it matter

The key question people have been talking about is how the SBA’s existing Affiliation rules will be applied to small businesses seeking PPP aide.

The affiliation rules are a set of standards that define the scope of consideration for size requirements when multiple parties have ownership interests in the firm – EG. VC-backed startups. Affiliation occurs when one company or person has control, or the power to control another.

If the controlling interest is deemed to be an affiliate, the size requirement is applied to all the entities of that affiliate 

- If Company A (Venture Firm) has a controlling stake in Company B (Startup), the size requirement is applied on the total employees of - Company B, Company A, and all of Company A's controlled entities

## Affiliation and the CARES Act
### Where can affiliation exist

Certain businesses have had the affiliation rules waived:

- Any business receiving financial assistance from a Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”).
- Franchises and hospitality businesses (NAICS code 72 “accommodation and food services”) with multiple locations, whereby the 500 person limitation is applicable to all individual locations
- religious organizations

However, for all other entities, the guidance in [13 C.F.R. § 121.301(f)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7655ef612afd00fe4fba93bfe9122ae7&mc=true&node=se13.1.121_1301&rgn=div8) applies. According to 
- [Treasury's Interim Final Rule](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/SBA%20IFR%202.pdf)
- [Treasury's Affiliation Guide](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Affiliation%20rules%20overview%20%28for%20public%29.pdf)
- Treasury's [FAQ](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Paycheck-Protection-Program-Frequenty-Asked-Questions.pdf) around affiliation 

Given this guidance, according to [Lowenstein & Sandler](https://www.lowenstein.com/news-insights/publications/client-alerts/sba-section-7-a-loans-for-venture-capital-backed-growth-companiesstartups-under-the-cares-act-the-tech-group)*, affiliation exists for any entity that:

- Owns +50% of voting equity  (Affiliation based on ownership)
- Can/will own +50% voting equity upon conversion of outstanding securities (affiliation based on  convertible/exercisable securities)
- has negative veto rights on day-to-day operations of the company (affiliation based on negative controls)
  - see [NVCA guide](https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VC-SBA-Lending-and-Affiliation-Guidance-for-SBA-Loan-Programs.pdf)
- has a common President or CEO (affiliation based on management)

*while no guidance is perfect, L&S and [Ed Zimmerman](https://twitter.com/EdGrapeNutZimm) have consistently been correct and ahead of the curve when it comes to affiliation
### Where will affiliation be applied with VC-backed companies
Given this guidance and interpretation, our understanding is that if a VC does not have: 
- +50% of voting rights currently
- +50% of voting rights upon exercise of any outstanding agreements
- applicable negative rights on day-to-day operations
- a common executive (CEO/President)

They are not affiliated with the company.
